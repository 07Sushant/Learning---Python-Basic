# 2. Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
# Take the user input for start and end of range.
# Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying
# other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1
# that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers
# Examples:
# 6 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
# 37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together
# to make it.
